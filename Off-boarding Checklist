The following is a checklist of steps to take when off-boarding from the group: 
  1. Send an e-mail to Nisha and CC your advisor with your end date 
  2. Fill out the following google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NfciWkCvV2dn9KJHe6kpUb6Bs9z4E9RW4wgwLCzoaog/edit
     Note: if your project is not completed you will have to designate someone to 
     take over the storage and completion of the project, please decide on who 
     this will be as this information is required in the google form.
